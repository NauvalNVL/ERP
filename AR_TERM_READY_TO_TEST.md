# ✅ AR_TERM SUDAH DIPERBAIKI - SIAP TEST!

## 🎯 Status: READY FOR TESTING

### **Test Results Summary:**

```
✅ Customer "000211-08" exists in CUSTOMER table
✅ Customer has TERM = 30 days
✅ InvoiceController logic updated to use numeric TERM
✅ Default payment term = 30 days
✅ Code will fetch from CUSTOMER table first
✅ Never NULL anymore!
```

---

## 📊 **Current Database Status**

### **CUSTOMER Table:**
```
CODE        NAME            TERM (days)
----------- --------------- -----------
000211-08   ABDULLAH, BPK   30          ✅
```

### **Current Invoices (OLD):**
```
All existing invoices have AR_TERM = NULL
(These were created before the fix)
```

### **New Invoices (AFTER FIX):**
```
Will have AR_TERM = 30 (or actual customer term)
AR_TERM will NEVER be NULL anymore! ✅
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Step 1: Create New Invoice**

1. Open: **Prepare Invoice by D/Order (Current Period)**
2. Select Customer: **000211-08** (ABDULLAH, BPK)
3. Select any DO for this customer
4. Process through all screens
5. Complete invoice creation

### **Step 2: Verify AR_TERM**

**Run this SQL query:**
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 
    IV_NUM, 
    AC_NUM, 
    AC_NAME, 
    AR_TERM,
    IV_DMY as Invoice_Date
FROM INV 
ORDER BY IV_NUM DESC
```

**Expected Result:**
```
IV_NUM           AC_NUM      AC_NAME         AR_TERM  Invoice_Date
---------------- ----------- --------------- -------- ------------
IV-202510-0011   000211-08   ABDULLAH, BPK   30       2025-10-31   ✅
```

**✅ AR_TERM should be 30, NOT NULL!**

### **Step 3: Check Logs**

**File:** `storage/logs/laravel.log`

**Look for:**
```
[info] Payment term found in CUSTOMER table
{
  "term_days": 30,
  "customer": "000211-08"
}
```

---

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed**

### **Problem:**
- AR_TERM was always NULL
- Code tried to get string value ('30D')
- But TERM column is DECIMAL (stores 30, 60, 90)

### **Solution:**
1. ✅ Updated code to use **numeric values** (30 instead of '30D')
2. ✅ Fetch from **CUSTOMER table** first
3. ✅ Fallback to **MC table** if needed
4. ✅ Default to **30 days** if not found
5. ✅ **Never NULL** anymore!

### **Code Changes:**
```php
// OLD (Wrong - tried to use string)
$paymentTerm = '30D'; // Wrong type!

// NEW (Correct - uses numeric)
$paymentTerm = 30; // Matches DECIMAL type!
```

## 📋 **Payment Term Meanings**

| AR_TERM Value | Payment Terms | Due Date Calculation |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 0 | COD (Cash On Delivery) | Pay immediately |
| 7 | 7 days | Invoice Date + 7 days |
| 14 | 14 days | Invoice Date + 14 days |
| 30 | 30 days (Net 30) | Invoice Date + 30 days |
| 45 | 45 days | Invoice Date + 45 days |
| 60 | 60 days (Net 60) | Invoice Date + 60 days |
| 90 | 90 days (Net 90) | Invoice Date + 90 days |

**Example:**
```
Invoice Date:  2025-10-31
AR_TERM:       30 days
Due Date:      2025-11-30
```

## ✅ **Pre-Test Checklist**

**Before creating test invoice:**

- [x] Customer exists in CUSTOMER table
- [x] Customer has TERM value (30 days)
- [x] InvoiceController code updated
- [x] Uses numeric payment term
- [x] Default is 30 days
- [x] Code deployed/saved

**All checks passed! Ready to test!** ✅

## 🚀 **After Testing**

### **If AR_TERM = 30:** ✅
```
SUCCESS! Everything works perfectly!
- AR_TERM is populated correctly
- Code is working as expected
- No more NULL values
- Production ready!
```

### **If AR_TERM = NULL:** ❌
```
Check:
1. Is customer in CUSTOMER table?
   SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CODE = '000211-08'

2. Does customer have TERM > 0?
   SELECT CODE, TERM FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CODE = '000211-08'

3. Check logs:
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log

4. Re-run test script:
   php test_ar_term_final.php
```

## 📞 **Quick Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: AR_TERM still NULL**

**Solution 1: Check Customer Data**
```sql
SELECT CODE, NAME, TERM 
FROM CUSTOMER 
WHERE CODE = '000211-08'
```
If TERM is NULL → Update it:
```sql
UPDATE CUSTOMER 
SET TERM = 30 
WHERE CODE = '000211-08'
```

**Solution 2: Check Code Deployment**
- Make sure InvoiceController.php is saved
- Clear Laravel cache: `php artisan cache:clear`
- Restart server if needed

**Solution 3: Check Logs**
```bash
tail -50 storage/logs/laravel.log
```
Look for "Payment term" messages

---

## 🎉 **Expected Final Result**

### **Database:**
```sql
SELECT IV_NUM, AC_NUM, AR_TERM FROM INV ORDER BY IV_NUM DESC

IV_NUM           AC_NUM      AR_TERM
---------------- ----------- --------
IV-202510-0011   000211-08   30       ✅ NEW INVOICE
IV-202510-0010   000211-08   NULL     (old)
IV-202510-0009   000211-08   NULL     (old)
```

### **Logs:**
```
✅ Payment term found in CUSTOMER table (term_days: 30)
✅ Invoice created successfully
✅ AR_TERM saved: 30
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- ✅ AR_TERM is NOT NULL
- ✅ AR_TERM = 30 (or actual customer term)
