# Unlock SKU Utility - ERP System

## Overview

The Unlock SKU Utility is a web-based tool designed to manage and unlock SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) that have been locked due to various reasons in the ERP system. This utility provides administrators and authorized users with the ability to safely unlock SKUs that are preventing normal business operations.

## Features

- **Bulk Unlock**: Unlock multiple SKUs simultaneously
- **Stale Lock Management**: Automatically identify and unlock locks older than 30 minutes
- **Real-time Statistics**: View lock statistics and trends
- **Search & Filter**: Find specific locked SKUs quickly
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all unlock operations

### üìä Dashboard Features
- **Lock Statistics**: Total locked, stale locks, recent locks (24h)
- **Top Lock Reasons**: Most common reasons for locks
- **Duration Tracking**: How long each SKU has been locked
- **Status Indicators**: Visual indicators for stale vs active locks

### üîç Search & Filter Capabilities
- Search by SKU code
- Search by SKU name
- Search by locked by user
- Search by lock reason
- Sort by any column
- Pagination support

## Why SKUs Get Locked

SKUs can become locked due to several reasons:

### 1. **Transaction Processing** üîÑ
- **Sales Orders (SO)**: SKU is being processed in an active sales order
- **Purchase Orders (PO)**: SKU is part of an active purchase order
- **Inventory Transactions**: SKU is being updated in inventory operations
- **Production Orders**: SKU is being used in manufacturing processes

### 2. **System Failures** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Network Timeouts**: Connection issues during data updates
- **Application Crashes**: Unexpected system shutdowns
- **Database Errors**: Transaction rollbacks or deadlocks
- **Session Timeouts**: User sessions expiring during edits

### 3. **User Session Issues** üë§
- **Incomplete Logouts**: Users closing browsers without proper logout
- **Multiple Sessions**: Same user logged in from multiple devices
- **Session Conflicts**: Concurrent access attempts

### 4. **Business Rules** üìã
- **Posted Documents**: SKU locked because it's part of a posted transaction
- **Approval Processes**: SKU awaiting approval workflow
- **Data Validation**: Failed validation preventing updates
- **Batch Processing**: SKU locked during bulk operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "SKU is not locked" Error
- **Cause**: SKU was already unlocked by another user
- **Solution**: Refresh the page and check current status

#### "Permission denied" Error

- **Solution**: Contact administrator for access

#### "Network error" During Unlock
- **Cause**: Connection issues or server problems
